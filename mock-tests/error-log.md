## 📖 How to Use This Log

1. **After every mock test or PYQ session**, review every wrong/unsure answer
2. Fill in one row per mistake with **all columns completed**
3. Review this log every **Sunday** to spot recurring patterns
4. Before each new mock, spend 15 min reviewing **recent entries** in this log
5. When you see the same error TYPE appearing 3+ times → do a **dedicated deep-dive session**

## 🏷️ Error Type Classification

| Code | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **C** | Conceptual | Didn't understand the underlying concept |
| **S** | Silly | Knew the concept but made a careless error (arithmetic, reading) |
| **T** | Time | Ran out of time; would have gotten it with more time |
| **U** | Unfamiliar | New/unseen question type; not covered in preparation |
| **A** | Assumption | Made a wrong assumption about the problem |
| **M** | Memory | Forgot a formula or fact that was memorized before |

## 📋 Error Log Table

| # | Date | Source (Test/PYQ) | Topic | Error Type (C/S/T/U/A/M) | Description of Mistake | Correct Approach | Prevention Strategy |
|---|------|-------------------|-------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Example | GATE Overflow Mock 1 | DSA - AVL Tree | C | Confused LR rotation with RL rotation | LR: first rotate left on child, then right on root; RL is opposite | Draw rotation diagrams on paper; create a visual mnemonic |
| 2 | Example | PYQ 2023 | OS - EAT | S | Used wrong formula: forgot to account for TLB miss time | EAT = h×(TLB+Mem) + (1-h)×(TLB+2×Mem) | Write formula before each numerical problem |
| 3 | Example | Made Easy Mock 1 | CN - Sliding Window | A | Assumed Go-Back-N window = 2^n; it's 2^n - 1 | Sender window for GBN = 2^n - 1; SR = 2^(n-1) | Make a table of sliding window sizes and memorize |

## 💡 Prevention Strategies Reference

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Write formula before solving | For numerical problems (COA, CN, OS memory) |
| Draw diagram first | For tree/graph problems, circuit problems |
| Re-read the question after solving | For all tricky MCQs |
| Check units and conversions | For any numerical answer |
| Use elimination on MCQs | When unsure — cross out clearly wrong options |
| Skip and return | When stuck for 2+ minutes |
| Mark and review | When unsure — flag for second pass |
