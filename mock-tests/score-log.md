## 💡 Analysis Rules

1. **Log immediately** after each test — don't wait
2. **Never skip analysis** — the post-test 2 hours = most valuable time
3. **Calculate subject-wise %** — helps identify weak areas quickly
4. **Track rank** (if available) — gives real-world competition context
5. **Write honest notes** — "got lucky on CN" vs. "genuinely understood"
