# 🔁 Revision Cycle 1 — First Complete Revision
### Target: Oct–Nov 2026 | Complete all 14 subjects

> **Purpose:** First full revision pass after initial learning. Focus on solidifying concepts, filling gaps, and completing PYQs.
> **Speed:** Not as fast as revision 2 or 3. Still reading all notes and solving problems.

## 📋 How to Use This Checklist

1. Go subject-by-subject in order (or by priority)
2. For each topic, check ✅ only after you can explain it without looking at notes
3. Log any gaps in the **Notes** section at the bottom
4. Target completion: **within 4 weeks**
