# 🔁 Revision Cycle 2 — Targeted Deep Revision
### Target: Nov–Dec 2026 | Focus on weak areas + PYQ second pass

> **Purpose:** Faster revision pass focused on WEAK AREAS identified in Revision 1 and mock tests. Includes second pass of all PYQs.
> **Speed:** 30–40% faster than Revision 1. Focus on weak spots and patterns.
