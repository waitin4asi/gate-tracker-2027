# 🔁 Revision Cycle 3 — Final Revision (Pre-Exam)
### Target: Jan 2027 | Quick review + Formula sheets + Last-minute tips

> **Purpose:** Fastest revision pass. Only review own notes and formula sheets. No new learning. Build confidence.
> **Speed:** Very fast — 30 min to 1 hour per subject maximum.
> **Rule:** If you don't know it by now, skip it. Don't learn new topics in January.

## ⚠️ Revision 3 Rules

1. **Only YOUR notes and formula sheets** — no textbooks, no GFG
2. **No new topics** — if something is unfamiliar, let it go
3. **Time yourself** — max 1 hour per subject
4. **Focus on high-weightage topics** only
5. **Visualize exam day** — you've prepared for this

- [ ] **1-mark strategy:** Spend max 2 min per question; skip and return if stuck
- [ ] **2-mark strategy:** Spend max 4 min per question; skip if over time
- [ ] **Negative marking:** Don't guess if completely unsure; skip MCQs
- [ ] **NAT (numerical):** No negative marking — always attempt
- [ ] **Time check:** At 90 min, check if 40+ questions attempted
- [ ] **Last 15 min:** Review flagged questions; verify NAT answers
- [ ] **Trust your preparation** — you've done the work

### Mental Reminders
> - "I have prepared systematically for 12 months. I trust my preparation."
> - "A tough question is tough for everyone. Move on, come back."
> - "GA is 15 free marks — do it confidently."
> - "Stay calm. Panic errors cost more than hard questions."
