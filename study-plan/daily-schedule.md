## 💡 Schedule Maintenance Tips

### ✅ Do's
- **Fix your wake-up time** — same every day, no exceptions
- **Use a physical planner or this tracker** to check off daily tasks
- **Start with the hardest subject** when your brain is freshest
- **Pomodoro Technique** — 50 min study, 10 min break (great for PYQs)
- **Hydrate** — keep water on your study desk at all times
- **Review tomorrow's plan** every night for 10 minutes
- **Track daily hours** — use a simple HH:MM log

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't study after 10:30 PM — sleep is non-negotiable
- Don't skip meals to study — blood sugar drops = poor retention
- Don't study with phone notifications on
- Don't compare your schedule to others' — find your rhythm
- Don't try to follow a 16-hour schedule — burnout is real
- Don't skip the daily review — it compounds understanding

### 📱 Recommended Apps
| App | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Forest / Focus Flow | Pomodoro + focus timer |
| Notion / Obsidian | Digital notes |
| Anki | Spaced repetition flashcards |
| Google Calendar | Schedule blocking |
| Streaks / Habitica | Habit tracking |
