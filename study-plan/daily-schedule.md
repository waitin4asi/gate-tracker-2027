## 🔥 Productivity Hacks

### Focus & Concentration
1. **Pomodoro with Twist:** 50 min deep work + 10 min break (better than 25/5 for complex topics)
2. **Phone in another room:** Not silent — literally in another room while studying
3. **Study music:** Brown noise / LoFi beats without lyrics (YouTube/Spotify)
4. **Start with hardest topic:** Tackle the subject you like least when willpower is highest
5. **"2-minute rule":** If a doubt takes <2 min to resolve, resolve immediately; else, log and continue

### Memory & Retention
6. **Spaced repetition:** Review notes after 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 21 days
7. **Teach-back method:** Explain concepts out loud as if teaching someone
8. **Mind maps:** For subjects with many interconnected concepts (OS, CN)
9. **Mnemonics:** Create memorable acronyms for lists/sequences
10. **Before sleep review:** Last 10 min before sleep = review day's key concepts

### Schedule Adherence
11. **Prep the night before:** Set up study materials before sleeping
12. **Track streaks:** Mark each day studied on a calendar — don't break the chain
13. **Fixed exam slot:** GATE is at a fixed time; practice at that time daily
14. **Batch similar tasks:** All note-making together, all PYQ solving together
15. **Reward system:** Small rewards for weekly milestone completions

### Energy Management
16. **Morning is gold:** Most GATE-level cognition requires morning freshness
17. **No heavy lunch:** Leads to post-lunch crash — eat light during study days
18. **Hydration:** 2–3 liters water/day — dehydration impairs memory
19. **Strategic caffeine:** Use tea/coffee only in afternoon, not throughout day
20. **Power nap:** 20-minute nap (set alarm) restores 2–3 hours of focus
