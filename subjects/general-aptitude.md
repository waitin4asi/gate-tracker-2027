## ⚡ Key Formulas & Shortcuts

### Percentages
```
x% of y = y% of x
A is x% more than B: B = A / (1 + x/100)
A is x% less than B: B = A / (1 - x/100)
Successive % change: (a + b + ab/100)%
```

### Simple & Compound Interest
```
SI = (P × R × T) / 100
CI = P × (1 + R/100)^T − P
CI − SI (for 2 years) = P × (R/100)²
```

### Time & Work
```
If A does work in 'a' days and B in 'b' days:
  Together in 1 day = 1/a + 1/b
  Together they finish in ab/(a+b) days
```

### Time, Speed & Distance
```
Speed = Distance / Time
Average speed (equal distances) = 2uv/(u+v)  [harmonic mean]
Relative speed:
  Same direction: u − v
  Opposite direction: u + v
```

### AP and GP
```
AP: aₙ = a + (n-1)d,   Sum = n/2 × [2a + (n-1)d]
GP: aₙ = ar^(n-1),     Sum = a(rⁿ−1)/(r−1) for r≠1
                        Sum∞ = a/(1-r) for |r|<1
```

### Ratio & Mixtures
```
Alligation rule: (C₁−Cm) / (Cm−C₂) = Q₂/Q₁
Where Cm = mean concentration, C₁, C₂ = concentrations
```
