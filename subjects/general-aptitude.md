## 📊 Overview

GA is 15 marks — the same in every GATE paper. Most candidates score 10–12; scoring 14–15 gives a massive edge over competition. The questions are learnable and predictable patterns. **30 min daily = 14+ marks guaranteed.**

**Scoring Pattern:**
- 2–3 Verbal Ability questions (grammar, vocabulary, RC)
- 2–3 Critical Reasoning questions
- 3–4 Numerical Ability questions
- 1–2 Data Interpretation / Logical Reasoning questions

## 📋 Key Formulas & Rules

### Arithmetic Quick Formulas
```
Percentage: (part/whole) × 100
% change: (new - old)/old × 100
Profit%: (profit/cost price) × 100
Discount%: (discount/marked price) × 100

SI = P × R × T / 100
CI = P(1 + R/100)ⁿ - P

Speed × Time = Distance
Relative speed (same dir) = |S₁ - S₂|
Relative speed (opposite) = S₁ + S₂

Combined work rate = 1/T₁ + 1/T₂
Time together = T₁T₂/(T₁+T₂)

Mixture: C₁V₁ + C₂V₂ = C(V₁+V₂)
Alligation ratio: (C₂-C)/(C-C₁)
```

### Geometry
```
Triangle: Area = ½ × base × height
Heron's: Area = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), s = (a+b+c)/2
Circle: Area = πr², Circumference = 2πr
Cylinder: Vol = πr²h, LSA = 2πrh
Sphere: Vol = 4πr³/3, SA = 4πr²
Cone: Vol = πr²h/3, LSA = πrl
```

### Clocks
```
Minute hand speed: 6°/min
Hour hand speed: 0.5°/min
Angle between hands: |30H - 5.5M|°
Hands coincide: every 65 5/11 minutes
```

### Calendars
```
Leap year: divisible by 4 (except century years, which need divisibility by 400)
Odd days in century: 100 yr = 5, 200 yr = 3, 300 yr = 1, 400 yr = 0
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **RC: Don't read extra meaning:** Stick strictly to what the passage says — no outside knowledge
2. **Work problems:** Don't directly add days; add RATES (work/day)
3. **Profit on cost or selling price?** Usually on cost price unless specified otherwise
4. **Relative speed:** Same direction = difference; opposite direction = sum
5. **Pie chart:** Convert percentage to degrees by multiplying by 3.6
6. **Compound interest formula:** (1 + r/n)^(nt) for n compounding periods/year
7. **Assumptions in CR:** An assumption must be unstated AND necessary for the conclusion
8. **Syllogism:** Use Venn diagrams; "some" means at least one; "no" means zero overlap
